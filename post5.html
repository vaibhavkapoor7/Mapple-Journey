          <p>Moving to a new country is exciting… but also overwhelming.</p>
          <p>When I first arrived in Canada, I did not even know where to start. What helped me the most, surprisingly, were free resources that many newcomers don’t realize exist.</p>
          <p>So I’m sharing them here, because every newcomer deserves support, community and a safe start.</p>

          <h2>BC Libraries Are Amazing!</h2>
          <img class="post__cover" src="images/post/post 5/1.png" alt="post cover">
          <p>It doesn’t matter what community you live in, you can visit any public library. Because each library is different, it is a good idea to visit the websites of different libraries to learn about their facilities, materials, programs, and events.</p>
          <p>There are 18 library systems in the Mainland / Southwest region of BC including libraries in communities across Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley. Some of these library systems have more than one location. In total, there are 85 library branches in the region.</p>

          <h2>Library Cards and the BC OneCard</h2>
          <p>You do not need a library card to visit a public library in BC. If you want to borrow materials from a library, you will need a library card. To get a library card, bring a piece of personal identification to the library in your community. At some BC libraries, you can sign up for a library card online!</p>
          <p>Once you have a library card from the library in your community, you can get a BC OneCard that will allow you to borrow materials from other libraries in BC. You can learn more about the BC OneCard at the library in your community.</p>

          <h2>Community Centres – connection, movement + skill building.</h2>
          <img class="post__cover" src="images/post/post 5/2.png" alt="post cover">
          <p>Community Centres here offer affordable programs that help you feel less isolated after moving to a new country.</p>
          <p>Community Centres provide services to low income and at-risk adults at Carnegie Community Centre, Evelyne Saller Centre, and Gathering Place Community Centre in the Downtown Eastside and Downtown South communities.</p>

          <h2>Find newcomer services</h2>
          <p>Moving to a new place can bring many opportunities, but also many challenges. After arriving in B.C., you may need help with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>looking for a job</li>
            <li>registering for language classes</li>
            <li>getting government and community services</li>
            <li>understanding the local culture, customs, and your rights</li>
            <li>making new friends</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Services for newcomers are free for you to access because the Government of B.C. funds organizations to provide these services. The services you receive are confidential, and are often provided by local community organizations, neighbourhood houses, or libraries. Workers at these organizations can often support you in your preferred language, in addition to providing services in English or French.</p>
          <p>Organizations that offer newcomers services have requirements that you must meet to get support. These requirements may be different depending on the kind of support you need. The best way to know if you are eligible to receive services is to contact the organization, and learn how they can help you and your family.</p>
          <p>In addition to the programs below, the Government of Canada funds organizations to provide <a href="https://ircc.canada.ca/english/newcomers/services/index.asp" style="color: #FE6807;">free services for permanent residents in B.C.</a></p>
